# Homebrew Guide

**Creating custom aptitudes and magic Circles**

This guide is for GMs and experienced players who want to expand Rath with their own content. If you just want to build a character, see the **Character Creation Guide** instead.

> **Note:** All starter content is complete and balanced—you don't need to create anything custom to have a full-featured game.

---

## Introduction

This guide explains how to create new aptitudes and Circles of Magic that fit seamlessly into Rath. Use these tools to:

- Design aptitudes that match your character concepts
- Create new Circles of Magic with unique themes
- Maintain balance with existing content
- Extend the system for your campaign world

**Who should use this guide:**
- GMs wanting to offer custom options to players
- Players working with their GM to realize unique concepts
- Designers wanting to understand the system's philosophy

**When to create custom content:**
- You have a character concept that existing aptitudes don't support
- You want a magic theme not covered by existing Circles
- Your campaign world needs setting-specific abilities
- You're adapting content from other systems

**When NOT to create custom content:**
- Just starting with the system (use existing content first)
- During character creation at session 1 (too much to learn)
- Without GM approval and collaboration
- To "fix" perceived balance issues (discuss with GM first)

# Part 1: Creating Aptitudes

Aptitudes are the mechanical abilities that define what your character can do. They should be **generally useful** without being **overpowered**.

---

## Aptitude Design Philosophy

**Aptitudes should:**

- Be **useful** - Clear purpose and application in most sessions
- Have **conditions or limitations** - Prevent them from being overpowered
- Fit a **theme** - Someone of a particular profession or species would have it
- Scale with **level** when appropriate - Use "L times per long rest" for abilities that get more powerful

**Avoid:**

- Flat, unconditional bonuses (like "+1 to hit on all attacks")
- Abilities without costs or triggers
- Overly complex mechanics that slow play
- Abilities that make other characters feel useless

---

## Types of Aptitudes

### Skill Aptitudes

Learned abilities that any character could potentially train in:

- **Combat skills** - Fighting techniques, weapon mastery, tactical abilities
- **Magic** - Spellcasting, magical enhancement, arcane knowledge
- **Exploration** - Stealth, survival, navigation, trap handling
- **Social** - Persuasion, intimidation, diplomacy, leadership
- **Knowledge** - Lore, languages, scholarly pursuits
- **Crafting** - Item creation, repair, modification

**Key principle:** Any dedicated student could theoretically learn these through training.

### Inherent Aptitudes

Innate traits tied to a character's physical nature or magical essence:

- **Sensory** - Enhanced senses, unusual perception abilities
- **Physical/Anatomical** - Natural weapons, armor, unusual body parts
- **Movement** - Flight, climbing, swimming, teleportation
- **Combat** - Natural fighting abilities, pack tactics, regeneration
- **Magical/Mystical** - Innate magic resistance, supernatural knowledge
- **Constructed** - Abilities for artificial or magical beings

**Key principle:** These define what a character IS, not what they've learned.

---

## Design Guidelines for Skill Aptitudes

### Combat Aptitudes

**Good triggers and conditions:**

- "When you reduce enemy to 0 HP" (Cleave)
- "When fighting 1-on-1" (Duelist)
- "When enemy misses you" (Riposte)
- "L times per long rest" (Mighty Blow)
- "Once per combat" (Whirlwind Strike)

**Examples to follow:**

- **Cleave**: Simple trigger (reduce to 0 HP), clear benefit (free attack), doesn't slow combat
- **Duelist**: Conditional advantage (1-on-1 only) + expanded crit range (18-20)
- **Shield Bash**: Active ability with cost (use action, requires shield), provides control (stun)

**Why these work:**
- Clear triggers that are easy to track
- Meaningful but not overwhelming benefits
- Reward specific playstyles without dominating
- Create interesting tactical decisions

**Avoid:**

- Unconditional bonuses without triggers (boring, unbalanced)
- Abilities that trigger too frequently (every attack becomes a chore)
- Complex calculations that slow combat (d20+STR+proficiency+situation-bonus-terrain...)
- "Passive +X to everything" abilities (make other characters feel worse)

### Magic Aptitudes

Magic aptitudes should enhance spellcasting without overshadowing the Circle system:

**Good patterns:**

- Modify spell mechanics (Spell Twister, Metamagic)
- Provide spell recovery (Arcane Recovery)
- Enhance specific casting styles (Swordspell, Ritual Caster)
- Offer defensive options (Spellshield, Counterspell)

**Examples:**

- **Spell Twister**: Once/long rest, change one scaling parameter without increasing DC (limited uses, GM approval required)
- **Metamagic**: L times/long rest, cast silently or without gestures (scales with level, situational benefit)
- **Blood Magic**: Take HP equal to DC to auto-succeed (high cost, desperate option)

**Why these work:**
- Expand what casters can do WITHOUT giving them more spells
- Create meaningful choices (when to use limited abilities)
- Support different casting styles (ritual, combat, subtle)
- Have costs or limitations

**Avoid:**
- "Cast one extra spell per day" (just makes casters better at everything)
- Reducing spell DCs without cost (breaks the scaling system)
- Abilities that eliminate spell weaknesses (armor doesn't hinder you)
- Making all Circles equally good at everything (homogenizes magic)

### Exploration Aptitudes

Exploration aptitudes should create interesting choices and enable specific playstyles:

**Good patterns:**

- Advantage on specific types of tests (Move Silently and Unseen, Wild Walker)
- Special abilities once per rest period (Shadow Step, Escape Artist)
- Passive benefits that enhance role (Dungeon Sense, Cartographer)
- Companion creatures that add options (Hunting Dog, Familiar)

**Consider:**

- Does this enable a specific archetype? (thief, scout, tracker)
- Does it create interesting decisions? (when to use limited abilities)
- Is it useful frequently enough? (avoid overly situational)

**Examples:**

- **Wild Walker**: Advantage in wilderness (defines clear niche)
- **Shadow Step**: Once/long rest teleport (strong but limited)
- **Cartographer**: Auto-map areas (always useful, never overpowered)

**Why these work:**
- Define clear niches (you're THE wilderness person)
- Useful regularly but not overwhelming
- Create opportunities for clever play
- Make exploration more interesting

**Avoid:**
- "You can't fail at X" (removes challenge)
- Too broad advantages (advantage on ALL tests)
- Abilities that only work in one specific scenario per campaign
- Replacements for player skill (auto-solve all puzzles)

### Social Aptitudes

Social aptitudes should enhance roleplay without replacing it:

**Good patterns:**

- Advantage on specific social tests (Silver Tongue)
- Once per encounter abilities (Fast Talk)
- Conditional bonuses (Intimidating Presence)
- Information gathering (Read Tells, Network)

**Important:**

- Should enhance roleplay, not replace it
- Should have reasonable limitations
- Should fit character archetype

**Examples:**

- **Silver Tongue**: Advantage to negotiate (but not mind control)
- **Fast Talk**: Reroll one failed CHA test (limited, clutch ability)
- **Network**: Know someone useful in each location (creates story hooks)

**Why these work:**
- Player still has to describe WHAT they say
- Dice help when it matters, don't auto-win
- Create story opportunities
- Reward social character builds

**Avoid:**
- Mind control or compulsion effects as aptitudes (that's magic)
- Automatic success on all social tests (boring)
- Abilities that short-circuit entire social encounters
- Making other players feel like they shouldn't talk

---

## Design Guidelines for Inherent Aptitudes

Inherent aptitudes define what a character IS rather than what they've learned.

### Physical/Anatomical Traits

**Consider:**

- How does this change the character's form?
- What are the trade-offs? (Natural Armor prevents manufactured armor)
- Is it always-on or situational?

**Examples:**

- **Natural Weapons**: 1d6+STR damage (comparable to weapons, always available)
- **Natural Armor**: +2 AC but can't wear manufactured armor (trade-off)
- **Demon Tail**: Can hold things but can't wield weapon (interesting limitation)

**Why these work:**
- Clear mechanical benefits
- Balanced by trade-offs or limitations
- Create interesting character concepts
- Always relevant (define your form)

**Avoid:**
- "Natural weapons AND armor AND claws AND..." (too much)
- No trade-offs (just better than everyone)
- Purely cosmetic traits masquerading as aptitudes
- Body parts that never matter in play

### Movement Traits

**Consider:**

- How does this change exploration and combat?
- What are the limitations? (can't use while hands full)
- Is it magical or physical?

**Examples:**

- **Leathery Wings**: Can't fly but can glide (limited benefit, interesting)
- **Spider Climb**: Climb at half speed, hands must be free (useful, balanced)
- **Forest Walk**: Step into trees (magical, thematic, limited by environment)

**Why these work:**
- Solve specific movement challenges
- Have clear limitations (not just "better")
- Create tactical options in combat
- Enable interesting exploration

**Avoid:**
- Unlimited teleportation (breaks encounters)
- Flight with no restrictions (trivializes many challenges)
- Speed bonuses without trade-offs (+10 ft all the time is boring)
- Movement that makes other characters irrelevant

### Magical/Mystical Traits

**Consider:**

- How does this reflect the character's nature?
- Does it create interesting story opportunities?
- Is it too powerful for always-on?

**Examples:**

- **Magic Resistance**: Advantage vs spells (strong but passive)
- **Soulspell**: Absorb spell without slot but lose original (interesting trade-off)
- **Innate Spellcasting**: Cast one spell L times/long rest (limited but reliable)

**Why these work:**
- Create unique magical identities
- Generate story hooks (why are you like this?)
- Balanced by limitations or costs
- Interact interestingly with the magic system

**Avoid:**
- Immunity to entire damage types (unless very narrow)
- Always-on spell effects with no cost (that's Circle of Magic)
- Abilities that let you "cheat" the magic system
- Generic magical bonuses (+1 to all magic tests)

---

## Balancing Aptitudes

### Power Level Guidelines

**Weak Aptitudes** (rarely useful or very limited):

- Passive +1 bonus in specific rare situations
- Ability usable once per week
- Very situational benefit that rarely applies
- Benefits that are purely cosmetic

**Example weak aptitude:**
"**Lucky Coin**: Once per month, you can flip a coin and call it for +1 on your next test."

**Why it's weak:** Too limited (once per month), too small benefit (+1), too unreliable (coin flip).

**Moderate Aptitudes** (the target):

- Advantage on specific types of tests
- Ability usable L times per long rest
- Once per combat abilities
- Always-on benefits with trade-offs

**Example moderate aptitudes:**
- **Cleave**: Free attack when you drop enemy (common trigger, useful benefit)
- **Wild Walker**: Advantage in wilderness (niche but substantial)
- **Shadow Step**: Teleport once per long rest (powerful but limited)

**Why they're moderate:** Useful regularly, meaningful benefits, clear limitations or triggers.

**Strong Aptitudes** (risk of overshadowing):

- Unconditional advantage on common tests
- Abilities usable every round
- Large bonuses without conditions
- Multiple benefits in one aptitude

**Example strong aptitude:**
"**Master Warrior**: +2 to all attack rolls, advantage on all STR tests, and +2 AC."

**Why it's too strong:** No conditions, multiple benefits, always active, makes combat characters strictly better.

**Most aptitudes should be Moderate.** A character with 2 Moderate aptitudes feels capable without being overpowered.

### Testing Your Aptitude

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Is it generally useful?** If it only applies in one specific scenario per session, it's too narrow
2. **Does it have appropriate limitations?** No unlimited power without costs or conditions
3. **Does it fit a clear theme?** What profession or species would have this? Why?
4. **Does it scale appropriately?** Should it use "L times per long rest" to grow with character?
5. **Would I be excited to choose this?** If not, it needs more interesting benefits or better flavor

**Compare to existing aptitudes:**

- Is it weaker or stronger than similar aptitudes?
- Does it overlap too much with another aptitude?
- Does it create interesting decisions, or is it just "always use this"?
- Would you feel bad if another player took this instead of you?

**Playtest questions:**

- Did it come up in most sessions?
- Did it create interesting moments or just passive benefits?
- Did other players feel overshadowed?
- Was it too complicated to remember/use?

---

## Example: Creating a New Aptitude

Let's walk through creating a new aptitude from concept to final version.

**Concept:** An aptitude for a character who's a master of thrown weapons

### First Draft

"**Thrown Weapon Master**: Advantage on all thrown weapon attacks"

**Problems:**
- Too simple and unconditional
- Doesn't create interesting decisions
- Just a flat bonus with no flavor
- Boring to use (always the same)

### Second Draft

"**Thrown Weapon Master**: After hitting with a thrown weapon, your next thrown weapon attack this combat has advantage. You can draw thrown weapons as a free action."

**Why this is better:**
- Creates a conditional benefit (must hit first)
- Rewards consecutive throws (builds momentum)
- Includes utility benefit (quick draw)
- Fits the archetype without being overpowered

**Remaining issues:**
- Lacks flavor
- Doesn't scale with level
- Might be too weak (only one advantage per hit)

### Final Version

"**Thrown Weapon Master**: After hitting with a thrown weapon, your next thrown weapon attack this combat has advantage. Additionally, you can draw thrown weapons as a free action, and you always seem to have one more throwing knife than anyone expects."

**Why the final version works:**
- Clear mechanical benefit (conditional advantage)
- Interesting decision point (when to throw vs melee)
- Utility benefit (quick draw)
- Narrative flavor (the last sentence)
- Comparable to other combat aptitudes
- Opens up thrown weapon as viable playstyle

**Could also add scaling:** "L times per long rest, you can throw a weapon with such force it deals +1d6 damage."

---

## Aptitude Templates

Use these templates as starting points for creating new aptitudes:

### Combat Aptitude Template

**[Name]**: When [trigger condition], [benefit]. [Optional: Frequency limitation]

**Examples:**
- **Cleave**: When you reduce enemy to 0 HP, free attack on another enemy in close range
- **Mighty Blow**: L times/long rest, declare before attack. If hit, roll damage twice, take higher

### Magic Aptitude Template

**[Name]**: [Frequency], [spell-related benefit or modification]. [Optional: Limitation or cost]

**Examples:**
- **Spell Twister**: Once/long rest, change one scaling parameter without increasing DC (GM approval)
- **Blood Magic**: Cast spell: take HP = DC to auto-succeed (still burns spell)

### Exploration Aptitude Template

**[Name]**: Advantage on [specific type of test]. [Optional: Additional benefit in niche]

**Examples:**
- **Wild Walker**: Advantage to track/hunt/forage/navigate in natural wilderness
- **Dungeon Sense**: Advantage to detect traps, secret doors, unusual construction. Can tell depth underground

### Social Aptitude Template

**[Name]**: Advantage on [social stat] to [specific social goal]. [Optional: Limitation]

**Examples:**
- **Silver Tongue**: Advantage on CHA to negotiate, improve reactions, convince risk (not against core interests)
- **Intimidating Presence**: Advantage to intimidate smaller creatures or with fewer HD than your level

---

# Part 2: Creating Circles of Magic

Circles define what type of magic a caster can perform. Each Circle provides a theme and spell framework.

---

## Circle Design Philosophy

**Circles should:**

- Have a **clear theme** that's easy to explain in one sentence
- Provide **versatile options** for different situations
- Allow for **creative problem-solving**
- Scale appropriately with the spell level system

**Avoid:**

- Circles that only do one thing (too narrow)
- Themes that overlap too much with existing Circles (redundant)
- Concepts that are too narrow or too broad (hard to use)
- Complexity that makes spellcasting tedious

---

## Choosing Your Theme

### Strong Themes

**Transmutation** - Alteration of matter and form

- Clear concept: change things
- Versatile: works on objects, creatures, materials
- Scalable: small changes to dramatic transformations
- Example spells: Stoneflesh, Shrink/Enlarge, Liquid Form

**Conjuration** - Creation and summoning

- Clear concept: bring things into existence
- Versatile: creatures, objects, elements
- Scalable: temporary to permanent, small to large
- Example spells: Conjure Flame, Summon Swarm, Fog Cloud

**Elementalism** - Fire, water, air, earth

- Clear concept: primal forces
- Versatile: damage, control, utility
- Scalable: small effects to devastating forces
- Example spells: Flame Jet, Stone Grasp, Whispering Wind

**Why these work:**
- Instantly understandable theme
- Can handle combat, exploration, and social situations
- Many possible spells within theme
- Distinct from each other

### Weak Themes (and how to fix them)

**"Weather Magic"** - Too narrow

- Problem: Only works outdoors, limited spell variety
- Fix: Broaden to "Nature" (includes plants, animals, weather)
- Or: Add to Elementalism (weather is air and water)

**"Attack Magic"** - Too general

- Problem: No clear identity, overlaps with everything
- Fix: Specify element or method (Elementalism for elemental damage)
- Or: Focus on specific attack style (Necromancy for death/decay)

**"Reality Warping"** - Too vague

- Problem: Could mean anything, no clear boundaries
- Fix: Focus on specific aspect (Fate for probability, Illusion for perception, Transmutation for matter)

**"Healing Magic"** - Too narrow

- Problem: Only one function, not versatile enough
- Fix: Broaden to "Holy" (healing + turn undead + blessings)
- Or: Part of divine/nature magic, not standalone Circle

---

## Creating Base Level Spells

Base level spells are the foundation of your Circle. They should be **useful** and **scalable**.

### The Framework

Every base spell needs:

1. **Effect** - What does it do?
2. **Target/Area** - What does it affect? (usually 1 target or 10 ft area)
3. **Range** - How far can you cast it? (usually 30 ft or touch)
4. **Duration** - How long does it last? (1 round for combat, 1 turn for exploration)

### Spell Creation Process

**Step 1: Start with the concept**

"I want to summon a demon to fight for me"

**Step 2: Find the appropriate base level**

A demon is person-sized and powerful. That's too much for base level.

**Analysis:**
- Size: Person-sized creatures are higher-level summons
- Power: Combat-effective creatures need to be limited
- Duration: Permanent summons are very high-level

**Step 3: Scale down to base level**

- **Size**: Person → Item (a small imp instead of a demon)
- **Duration**: Permanent → 1 round (temporary summoning)
- **Number**: Many → 1 (single creature)
- **Power**: Full stats → Simple commands, basic attacks

**Step 4: Write the base spell**

**Summon Imp** - Summon 1 imp (item-sized) to obey your commands for 1 round

**Step 5: Identify what can scale**

- **Size**: Item → Object → Person (imp → demon → greater demon)
- **Duration**: 1 round → 3 rounds → 1 turn → 1 hour
- **Number**: 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 imps
- **Power**: Basic commands → Complex tactics → Independent action

**Result:** A useful base spell that can scale to meet different needs.

### Scaling Guidelines

Each enhancement should add roughly the same power level:

**Damage spells:**
- +1d to damage = +1 DC
- ×2 area = +1 DC
- +10 ft range = +1 DC

**Duration spells:**
- +1 round/turn/hour/day = +1 DC (choose appropriate to spell)

**Target spells:**
- +1 target = +1 DC
- Bigger target size = +2 DC per size category

**Complexity:**
- Simple → Moderate = +1 DC
- Moderate → Complex = +2 DC

**Examples:**

**Base:** Conjure Flame - 10 ft fireball, 1d4 fire damage (DC 12)
- 2d4 damage → DC 13 (+1 enhancement)
- 20 ft fireball → DC 13 (+1 enhancement)
- 2d4 damage, 20 ft → DC 14 (+2 enhancements)

**Base:** Stoneflesh - +1 AC for 1 round (DC 12)
- +2 AC for 1 round → DC 13 (+1 enhancement)
- +1 AC for 3 rounds → DC 14 (+2 enhancements)
- +2 AC for 3 rounds → DC 15 (+3 enhancements)

---

## Creating 8 Spells for Your Circle

Each Circle should have 8 example spells that showcase different aspects of the theme.

### The Eight Spell Framework

1. **Basic Damage/Attack** - Direct harm or obstacle
2. **Control/Hinder** - Slow, restrain, or debuff enemies
3. **Utility/Creation** - Create useful objects or effects
4. **Enhancement** - Buff allies or self
5. **Detection/Information** - Learn things or sense hidden
6. **Movement/Escape** - Mobility or defensive repositioning
7. **Area Effect** - Affect multiple targets or large area
8. **Unique/Signature** - Something special to this Circle

**Why this framework:**
- Ensures versatility (combat + exploration + social)
- Covers different playstyles
- Makes Circle feel complete
- Easy to reference during creation

**Example: Circle of Transmutation**

1. **Lightfoot** (Movement) - Ignore difficult terrain, move silently
2. **Stoneflesh** (Enhancement) - +1 AC
3. **Alter Object** (Utility) - Change material of objects
4. **Shrink/Enlarge** (Control) - Change size of creatures
5. **Mend** (Utility) - Repair broken items
6. **Animal Shape** (Enhancement) - Gain animal traits
7. **Purify Matter** (Utility) - Remove poison/disease/rot
8. **Liquid Form** (Unique) - Become fluid

**Coverage checklist:**
- ✓ Combat options (Stoneflesh for defense, Shrink/Enlarge for control)
- ✓ Exploration utility (Alter Object, Mend, Purify, Lightfoot)
- ✓ Social/interesting (Animal Shape, Liquid Form)
- ✓ Versatile at different scales (all can be enhanced)

---

## Example: Creating a New Circle

Let's create a complete Circle from scratch.

### Circle of Sound

**Theme:** Manipulation of sound, vibration, and resonance

**Core concept:** Control sound waves for communication, offense, defense, and exploration

**Why this theme works:**
- Clear, understandable concept
- Versatile (combat, exploration, social)
- Distinct from existing Circles
- Lots of creative spell possibilities

### Step 1: Brainstorm spell concepts

- Create loud noise to distract
- Silence an area
- Use sound as a weapon
- Amplify or dampen sounds
- Communicate over distance
- Shatter objects with resonance
- Create echoes to map area
- Throw voice

### Step 2: Create 8 base level spells

1. **Thunderclap** (Damage)
   - 10 ft burst of sound, 1d4 damage
   - Enhancements: +1d4, ×2 area, +10 ft range

2. **Silence** (Control)
   - 10 ft area of silence for 1 round
   - Enhancements: ×2 area, +1 round

3. **Amplify Voice** (Utility)
   - Your voice carries to far distance (60 ft) for 1 turn
   - Enhancements: +60 ft, +1 turn, affect sounds beyond voice

4. **Muffle Steps** (Enhancement)
   - One creature moves silently for 1 turn
   - Enhancements: +1 target, +1 turn

5. **Echo Sense** (Detection)
   - Send out soundwave to map near area (30 ft) through walls, 1 round
   - Enhancements: +30 ft, +1 round, more detail

6. **Sonic Burst** (Area)
   - Push creatures 10 ft in 10 ft cone with sound
   - Enhancements: +10 ft distance, ×2 area, 1d4 damage

7. **Shatter** (Damage)
   - Item-sized brittle object shatters (glass, pottery, thin wood)
   - Enhancements: increase size, affect tougher materials

8. **Ventriloquism** (Unique)
   - Project your voice to near range point (30 ft) for 1 round
   - Enhancements: +30 ft, +1 round, multiple voices

### Step 3: Verify coverage

- ✓ Damage (Thunderclap, Shatter)
- ✓ Control (Silence, Sonic Burst)
- ✓ Utility (Amplify Voice, Ventriloquism)
- ✓ Enhancement (Muffle Steps)
- ✓ Detection (Echo Sense)
- ✓ Variety of situations (combat, stealth, exploration, social)
- ✓ Scalable options (all can be enhanced)

**Analysis:**
- **Combat**: Thunderclap for damage, Sonic Burst for area control, Silence to counter casters
- **Exploration**: Echo Sense for mapping, Muffle Steps for stealth, Shatter for breaking obstacles
- **Social**: Amplify Voice for speeches/intimidation, Ventriloquism for deception/distraction
- **Unique flavor**: All spells feel thematically connected to sound

**Result:** A complete, balanced Circle that's distinct from existing options.

## Advanced Spell Creation

### Complex Spell Scaling

Some spells scale in multiple ways:

**Summon Elemental**
- Base: Summon 1 item-sized elemental for 1 round
- Can scale: size, duration, number, elemental type

**Example scalings:**
- DC 13: Summon 1 item-sized elemental for 2 rounds (+1 duration)
- DC 14: Summon 1 object-sized elemental for 1 round (+2 size categories)
- DC 16: Summon 3 item-sized elementals for 1 round (+2 number)
- DC 18: Summon 1 person-sized elemental for 3 rounds (+3 size, +2 duration)

**Why allow multiple scaling:**
- Gives caster flexibility
- Same spell useful at different levels
- Rewards system mastery
- Creates interesting choices

### Spells with Saves

Some spells require targets to make saves:

**Base pattern:**
- Target makes [STAT] test vs DC 12
- Each enhancement to DC = +1 spell DC

**Example: Charm Person**
- Base: Target within 30 ft makes WIS test DC 12 or becomes friendly for 1 turn
- +1 DC: WIS test DC 13 (+1 enhancement)
- +1 turn: Lasts 2 turns (+1 enhancement)
- +1 target: Affects 2 targets (+1 enhancement)

**Total cost for DC 13, 2 turns, 2 targets = DC 15 spell (3 enhancements)**

**Design notes:**
- Base save DC always 12 (consistent)
- Increasing save DC costs same as other enhancements
- Makes spells work on tougher enemies at higher cost

### Permanent Effects

Permanent effects are high level by nature:

**Guidelines:**
- Small permanent changes: DC 15-18 (permanent light on object, minor transformation)
- Significant permanent changes: DC 18-21 (create permanent servant, major transformation)
- Always allow ritual casting to reduce DC
- Consider requiring rare materials or long casting times

**Example: Permanent Familiar from Circle of Conjuration**
- Base: Call Familiar (small creature, 1 hour) - DC 12
- Make permanent: +6 DC
- Total: DC 18 or DC 12 with 6 turns of ritual

**Why permanent effects are expensive:**
- Change game world permanently
- Can create permanent resources
- Could be abused if too cheap
- Should feel like major accomplishments

## Testing Your Circle

### Balance Checklist

**Versatility:**
- ☐ Combat options (damage or control)
- ☐ Exploration utility (detection, movement, or manipulation)
- ☐ Social potential (communication, enhancement, or illusion)

**Power Level:**
- ☐ Base damage comparable to other Circles (1d4-1d6 for damage spells)
- ☐ Duration comparable (1 round combat, 1 turn exploration)
- ☐ Range reasonable (30 ft or touch for most)

**Theme:**
- ☐ Every spell fits the Circle's concept
- ☐ Spells feel distinct from other Circles
- ☐ Theme is easy to explain in one sentence

**Playability:**
- ☐ Spells create interesting decisions
- ☐ Scaling is intuitive
- ☐ No spells are strictly better than others at base level

### Playtesting

**Test these scenarios:**

1. **Combat encounter:** Can the Circle contribute meaningfully?
2. **Dungeon exploration:** Does it provide useful options?
3. **Social situation:** Can it enhance roleplay?
4. **Problem-solving:** Does it enable creative solutions?

**Red flags:**
- Circle only works in one type of situation
- Spells are too similar to each other
- Scaling feels arbitrary or confusing
- Players confused about what the Circle does
- One spell gets used 90% of the time

**Green lights:**
- Players excited to try different spells
- Creative uses emerge during play
- Feels distinct from other Circles
- Works at multiple character levels

---

### Template: Utility-Focused Circle

**Theme:** [Your utility focus]

**Example spells:**

1. Create/summon useful item
2. Repair/modify object
3. Enhance item or creature
4. Detect/sense
5. Communicate
6. Movement utility
7. Environmental manipulation
8. Problem-solving spell

**Use for:** Artifice, conjuration, support magic

**Examples:** Creation magic, enhancement magic, detection

# Part 3: Putting It All Together

## Creating a Custom Class

A class is simply a combination of 2 aptitudes + keywords. Here's the full process:

### Step 1: Concept

"I want to play a battle-mage who uses sound magic and fights with weapons"

### Step 2: Choose or Create Aptitudes

**Option A: Use existing aptitudes**
- Circle of Magic (Sound) - custom Circle
- Swordspell (cast while wielding weapon) - existing aptitude

**Option B: Create custom aptitude**
- Circle of Magic (Sound) - custom Circle
- Sonic Blade - When you hit with melee weapon, can release sonic wave as free action: near range line, 1d4 damage, L times per long rest (custom aptitude)

### Step 3: Assign Keywords

- Species: Human (2 Skill Aptitudes)
- Role: Sonic Knight or Sound Blade
- Background: (choose during play)

### Step 4: Stats and Gear

Distribute stats focusing on INT (for magic) and STR or DEX (for combat)

Choose a one-handed weapon for Swordspell

### Result

**Sonic Knight** (Human)
- Aptitudes: Circle of Magic (Sound), Swordspell
- Keywords: Human, Sonic Knight
- Playstyle: Frontline combatant who weaves magic into weapon attacks

---

## Example: Completely Custom Character

### Concept

"A construct built as a siege weapon who's gone rogue"

### Aptitudes (2 Inherent = Demihuman)

1. **Reinforced Frame** (Inherent) - Advantage to resist knocked prone/pushed/grappled, count as one size larger
2. **Integrated Tool** (Inherent) - Built-in ballista (counts as crossbow, can't be disarmed, no inventory slots)

**Result:** Demihuman Construct

### Keywords

- Species: Siege Construct (custom, combines both aptitudes)
- Role: Artillery or Construct (could add role keyword later)
- Background: Rogue Weapon (adds now for flavor)

### Stats

Distribute: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0

**Example distribution:**
- STR 2, DEX 1, INT 0, WIS 1, CON 3, CHA 2

### Gear

- Weapon: Integrated ballista (d8, 3 slots worth but no slots used)
- Armor: No armor needed (rely on AC from DEX + future armor)
- Starting gear: Standard equipment

### Result

**Artillery** - Siege Construct, Rogue Weapon

- HP: 10 + 2 = 12
- AC: 10 + 1 (DEX) = 11
- Inventory: 10 + 3 = 13 slots
- Built-in weapon, very difficult to knock down or move, designed to be alone on battlefield

**Narrative hooks:**
- Why did you go rogue?
- Who built you and for what war?
- How do you feel about your purpose?
- What does freedom mean to a construct?

## GM Approval and Balance

### The Conversation

Creating custom content is a **collaborative process**:

**Player:** "I want to create an aptitude called Shadow Strike that lets me teleport to an enemy and attack with advantage."

**GM:** "That's interesting. How often can you use it?"

**Player:** "Maybe once per combat?"

**GM:** "That's pretty strong since it's both movement and advantage. What if it's L times per long rest, so you start with just once but it scales?"

**Player:** "That works! And maybe I can only teleport to shadows?"

**GM:** "Perfect, that adds interesting decision-making and fits the theme."

**Result:** Both player and GM happy with balanced, thematic ability.

### Red Flags for GMs

**Aptitude concerns:**
- No limitations or costs ("I want to teleport anywhere anytime")
- Strictly better than existing aptitudes ("Like Cleave but also +2 damage")
- Affects too many situations ("Advantage on all tests")
- Too complex to adjudicate quickly (requires 5 minutes of calculation)

**Circle concerns:**
- Overlaps too much with existing Circles ("It's like Transmutation but better")
- No clear theme or too narrow ("Magic of Tuesdays")
- Base spells too powerful or weak (1d10 damage at base, or just cosmetic effects)
- Scaling doesn't make sense (+1 DC for +10d6 damage)

### Green Lights

**Good signs:**
- Fits established patterns (similar to existing aptitudes/Circles)
- Creates interesting decisions (when to use limited abilities)
- Comparable power to existing options
- Easy to understand and use
- Enhances character concept without overshadowing others
- Player excited about the theme, not just the power

## Advancement and Growth

### Gaining Custom Aptitudes

At levels 3, 5, 7, 9: choose new aptitudes

**Custom Skill Aptitudes:** Work with GM to create, follow guidelines in this document

**Custom Inherent Aptitudes:** Require GM approval and narrative justification:
- With demihuman keyword: Can gain related Inherent Aptitudes
- Through transformation: Gain new keyword through major story event
- Significant cost: Resources, time, quest, or permanent character change

### Evolving Your Character

**Keywords can change:**
- Gain new keywords through story (Exiled, Cursed, Chosen)
- Keywords justify new aptitudes
- Background keywords earned through play

**Custom aptitudes can be created:**
- Work with GM at level-up
- Base on character's experiences
- Follow guidelines in this document
- Iterate based on playtesting

**Circles can be learned:**
- Must have one Circle to learn another
- Each Circle = one aptitude choice
- Maximum 6 total aptitudes
- Can create custom Circles using this guide

# Quick Reference

## Aptitude Balance Quick Check

☐ Generally useful (not too narrow)
☐ Has limitations or costs (not always-on power)
☐ Fits clear theme (profession or species trait)
☐ Comparable to existing aptitudes
☐ Creates interesting decisions
☐ Would you be excited to play this?

## Circle Balance Quick Check

☐ Clear theme (one sentence explanation)
☐ 8 diverse spells (combat, utility, unique)
☐ Base spells are useful and scalable
☐ Scaling is intuitive
☐ Comparable power to existing Circles
☐ Distinct from other Circles

## Spell Creation Quick Reference

**Base spell needs:**
- Effect (what it does)
- Target/Area (1 target or 10 ft)
- Range (30 ft or touch)
- Duration (1 round or 1 turn)

**Common enhancements:**
- +1d damage = +1 DC
- +1 target = +1 DC
- +1 round/turn = +1 DC
- ×2 area = +1 DC
- +10 ft range = +1 DC

# Final Thoughts

The beauty of Rath's customization system is its flexibility. You can:

- **Use everything as written** - The starter classes and preset Circles provide a complete, balanced game
- **Mix and match** - Combine existing aptitudes in new ways
- **Create selectively** - Make one custom aptitude or Circle while using the rest as written
- **Build from scratch** - Design completely unique characters and magic systems

The key is communication between players and GM. Custom content should enhance everyone's fun, not create balance problems or slow play.

**When in doubt:**
- Compare to existing content
- Start conservative and buff later if needed
- Focus on what's fun and interesting
- Remember that narrative justification matters more than mechanical perfection
- Playtest and iterate

**Remember:** The best custom content:
- Solves a specific problem ("I want to play X but can't with existing options")
- Fits the game world and tone
- Creates interesting stories
- Makes everyone at the table happy

Now go forth and create amazing characters and magic!
