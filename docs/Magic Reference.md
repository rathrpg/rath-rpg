# Magic Reference

**Complete magic system reference for spellcasters**

This document contains everything you need to cast spells in Rath RPG. Use it to understand casting mechanics, spell scaling, and all available spells across the 12 Circles of Magic.

> **For magic aptitudes:** See the **Aptitude Reference** | **For advanced casting options:** See the **GM Reference**

---

## How Magic Works

**Casters** learn **Circles** as **Aptitudes** (Circle of Magic). Each Circle provides themed magical effects.

Spells must be **equipped** to **inventory slots** to use. Each spell takes one slot. Equip same spell multiple times to cast repeatedly. Change spells during **long rest** or between sessions.

Casting a spell makes it **Burnt**—can't cast again until long rest (or short rest to unburn one spell). Burnt spells stay in inventory, become unburnt after resting.

---

## Casting a Spell

|Step|Action|
|---|---|
|1. Declare effect|Tell GM what you want|
|2. GM sets DC|Base (12) + enhancements|
|3. Roll casting test|d20 + INT or WIS vs DC (depends on Circle)|
|4. Resolve|See result table|

### Casting Stats

- **INT-based Circles:** Transmutation, Manipulation, Conjuration, Mentalism, Unholy, Entropy, Artifice, Elementalism, Fate & Dream, Necromancy
- **WIS-based Circles:** Holy, Nature

### Casting Results

|Roll|What Happens|
|---|---|
|**DC or higher**|✓ Success, spell burnt, no HP loss|
|**DC + 10+**|✓ Success, KEEP spell (not burnt), no HP loss|
|**Below DC (miss by 1-8)**|✓ Success, spell burnt, lose HP = amount missed by|
|**Miss by 9+**|✗ Fail, spell burnt, lose HP = amount missed by|

_Natural 20 always succeeds_

### Spell Management

- Spells must be equipped to inventory slots (each spell = 1 slot)
- Casting makes spell "Burnt" until long rest
- **Short rest**: Can unburn one spell of your choice
- **Long rest**: Unburn all spells, can change equipped spells

---

## Scaling Your Spells

Base spell = DC 12. Each enhancement = +1 DC.

### Enhancements (+1 DC each)

|Enhancement|Effect|
|---|---|
|+1 Round/Turn/Hour/Day|Duration lasts longer|
|+1 Target|Affect one more creature/object|
|+1 Step|More damage (+1d), higher bonus (+1), better effect|
|×2 Area|Double radius or cube size|
|+10 ft Range|Reach farther|
|Bigger Target|Affect larger creatures (+2 DC per size category)|
|Increase Complexity|Affect more complex mechanisms/effects|

**Example:** **Stoneflesh** (base): +1 AC for 1 round - DC 12

- +1 AC for 3 rounds → DC 14 (2 enhancements: +2 duration)
- +2 AC for 1 round → DC 13 (1 enhancement: +1 step)
- +1 AC, 3 rounds, 2 targets → DC 16 (4 enhancements: +2 duration, +1 target)

---

## Rituals

Take extra time to reduce DC. Each additional **round** or **turn** (GM decides): **-1 DC**

Caster can't move or take other actions. May need protection.

**Example:** Permanent familiar summoning = DC 18. Ritual for 6 turns (1 hour) → DC 12.

---

## Size Categories

Used for spells, targeting, and enhancements:

| Size | Description |
|---|---|
| **Item** | Small enough to carry (cat, dagger) |
| **Object** | Too big to carry, smaller than person (barrel, door) |
| **Person** | Human-sized and above |
| **Warhorse** | Horse-sized and above |
| **Elephant** | Elephant-sized or bigger |

---

## Optional Advanced Casting

> **See the GM Reference for complete rules on these advanced techniques**

### Cooperative Casting

Multiple casters work together, splitting DC between them. All must know the same Circle and have a spell equipped. One designated primary caster.

**Example:** Two casters, DC 17 → split to 9 each

### Sacrifices

Reduce spell DC through offering something of value:

**Attribute Sacrifice:** Reduce a stat → **-2 DC per point** (1 week recovery per point)

**Precious Object:** Destroy meaningful item → **-3 to -7 DC** (based on significance)

**Life Sacrifice (Dark Magic):** Sacrifice living creatures → **-1 to -7 DC** (severe narrative consequences)

## Creating Your Own Spells

**Base Level Spells Should Be:**

- **Useful** - Clear purpose and application
- **Scalable** - Enhancements for more power
- **Thematic** - Fits Circle's concept

**Start Simple:**

- Define basic effect at minimum power
- Add duration if needed (1 round combat, 1 turn exploration)
- Specify range (usually 30 ft or touch)
- Note targets/area (usually 1 target or 10 ft)

**Example:** _"I want to summon a demon to help in combat."_

Start smaller at base level:

- **Size:** Imp (item-sized) not demon (person-sized)
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Number:** 1 creature

**Result: Summon Imp** - 1 imp obeys for 1 round

Scale up for larger creatures, more imps, or longer duration.

---

## Quick Casting Example

1. _"I cast Conjure Flame to blast that orc!"_
2. GM: _"Base DC 12. Make it stronger?"_ Player: _"4d4 damage!"_ GM: _"3 extra steps, DC 15"_
3. Player rolls: d20 + INT = 18
4. 18 beats 15 → spell succeeds, spell burnt, no HP cost
