# Welcome to Rath

Rath is a hack of Knave (By Ben Milton) that incorporates some Ideas of other Knave hacks, with some tweaking and new ideas to suit my table. I originally wanted it to be compatible with existing OSR material (Basic Fantasy modules, etc), but it's quickly outgrowing that. A lot of compatibility still exists, but is obfuscated by things like changed systems. Compatibility can be restored by treating spells from other sources as "hard coded" level spells, so a LVL 3 spell will always be cast at LVL 3. That should get you most of the way there.  
  
The intent of this hack specifically, though, is to have a more full and robust character creation system that really makes each character feel unique. Player's can pick a class or race, some spells, and get started in moments, but there's an easy to use underlying system that gives players the freedom to create anything can be imagined.  
  
**You can absolutely use all of the starter classes and spells as is, and still have a full featured game that runs fast and easy.** The customization system is there if you want it, but never needs to be touched.  
  
Admittedly, and this came as a surprise to me, the magic system is probably the most complex part of the game. In playtesting, I found the original Knave system lacking. The current system grew out of iterating on that system. It provides a risk/reward system, some limitations that start to fall away if the character specializes in spell casting, and in play, can be very narratively focused.

_Note: I used Claude Code in the compilation of the current state of the rules and to help generate final rule files. The game design is mine. Rath was originally used as a custom ruleset for me, my family, and my friends, but I think that it contains good ideas that others might benefit from. If you object to the use of AI in creative projects, Rath RPG might not be for you._
