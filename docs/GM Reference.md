# GM Reference

Reference for running Rath RPG sessions.

## Make It Your Own

Rath was built on player-GM negotiation. The aptitudes and spells in this book are a starting point, not a limit. **The Homebrew Guide is one of your most important resources**—use it.

**Do what feels right for your game:**
- If a player wants a flying character and it fits your world, figure out how to let them have it
- Don't be afraid to create new aptitudes—or modify existing ones if they're too powerful or too limited
- Create whole new Circles of Magic if a player wants to do something weird, or if it fits an NPC faction
- The rules exist to support your table, not constrain it

**When players ask for something unusual:**
1. Say "yes, and let's figure out how" instead of "no"
2. Work together to find the right mechanical fit
3. Adjust after play if it doesn't work out—that's expected, not failure

The best Rath campaigns emerge from this collaboration. Players invested in their character concepts will engage more deeply with your world.

## NPC Reactions

When NPC reaction isn't obvious, roll **2d6**:

| Roll | Reaction |
|---|---|
| 2 | Hostile - Attack or threaten |
| 3-5 | Unfriendly - Suspicious, unhelpful |
| 6-8 | Unsure - Waiting to see what PCs do |
| 9-11 | Talkative - Willing to help (for a price) |
| 12 | Helpful - Genuinely friendly |

**Modifiers:** +1 polite, -1 rude, +2 gift/favor, -2 bad reputation

## Morale

NPCs have a **morale rating** (5-9). When facing danger, roll **2d6**. If result > morale, NPC flees or parleys.

**Triggers:**
- Half the group defeated
- Leader killed
- Lone enemy at half HP
- Overwhelming odds

**Ratings:**

| Rating | Type        | Examples                 |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 5      | Cowardly    | Goblins, bandits         |
| 6-7    | Average     | Hired guards, humanoids  |
| 8      | Brave       | Soldiers, loyal guards   |
| 9      | Fearless    | Elite warriors, fanatics |
| 10+    | Never flees | Undead, constructs       |


**Henchmen:** Test when employer dies, unpaid, traumatic danger, or offered better deal.

## Doom Dice

Create a **dice pool timer** for impending events. Use **6-10 d6s**.

**Each turn/interval:**
1. Roll all remaining dice
2. Remove up to 2 dice showing **5-6**
3. When **last die removed**, event happens

**Examples:**
- Flooding dungeon (8d6)
- Pursuing enemies (6d6)
- Ritual completing (10d6)
- Reinforcements arriving (7d6)

## Traps and Locks

**Detecting Traps:** WIS test DC 12, spend turn examining 10 ft area.

**Disabling/Picking:** DEX test DC 12 with **disadvantage** (requires thieves' tools).

**Fail by 5+:** Trap triggers or tools break (1 gp to replace).

**The Advantage Scale:**

| Situation | Result |
|---|---|
| Complex trap/lock | Shift down one step |
| Break and Enter aptitude | Shift up (can work without tools) |
| Dungeon Sense/Trapsmith | Learn complexity + shift up |

**Simple vs Complex:**
- **Simple:** Tripwire, basic lock, pit trap
- **Complex:** Multi-stage, master locks, magical wards

## Encounter Balance

- **Equal level monster** = moderate challenge for 1 PC
- **2-3 equal level** = tough fight for party
- **Higher level** = threatens entire party

Use morale - not every fight to the death.

## Funnels and Level 0 Characters

A funnel is a deadly adventure where each player controls multiple fragile characters. The goal is to discover who your character becomes through play rather than planning it beforehand.

**Level 0 Creation:**
- Each player makes **5 characters**
- **Must** roll stats (no stat array) - use "Roll the Bones" method
- No aptitudes, no weapons, no armor
- Still roll on other gear tables (Dungeoneering, General Gear)
- 10 HP, no stats apply yet

**During the Funnel:**
- Characters can gain **keywords** when appropriate moments arise
- Player: "My character has fighter training, so he should get advantage here"
- GM agrees → character gains "Fighter" keyword
- Keywords grant advantage in relevant situations
- Can gain species keywords (Dwarf, Elf) and role keywords (Fighter, Thief) as play reveals character identity
- No mechanical aptitudes yet - save that for after survival

**After the Funnel:**
- Each player picks **one surviving character** to promote to level 1
- Apply stats from rolled values
- Choose **two aptitudes** that fit the character's actions during the funnel
- Finalize keywords (species + role, add background if appropriate)
- Calculate proper HP (10 + STR), AC, and inventory
- Character is now a full level 1 PC

**Why Run a Funnel:**
- High-stakes introduction to the game world
- Discover character through play, not pre-planning
- Create investment through survival
- Multiple perspectives on the situation
- Memorable origin stories for level 1 characters

## Advanced Casting Options

### Cooperative Casting

Multiple casters work together, splitting DC between them.

**Requirements:**
- All know same Circle
- Can communicate
- All have spell equipped (or equivalent from Circle)
- One designated **primary caster**

**Mechanics:**
1. GM determines total DC
2. Divide DC among casters (round up)
3. Each rolls casting stat test vs their portion
4. **All succeed:** Full power, all spells burnt
5. **Some succeed, some fail:** Works, failing casters take HP = missed by, primary takes 1d4 HP
6. **All fail:** Fails, all casters take HP = missed by

**Examples:**
- Two casters, DC 17 → split to 9 each
- Three casters, DC 20 → primary takes 8, helpers take 6 each

**Notes:** Safer for high-DC spells but more dice = more failure risk. Can combine with rituals.

---

### Sacrifices

Reduce spell DC through sacrifice—offering something of value to fuel magic. Dangerous and costly.

#### Attribute Sacrifice (Personal Cost)

Temporarily weaken yourself to power spell.

- Reduce one stat by 1 → **-2 DC** per point
- Affects all tests and derived stats (HP, AC, etc.)
- **Recovery:** 1 week rest per point
- Can sacrifice multiple points, can't reduce below -3

**Example:** Reduce STR 1 to -1 (sacrifice 2 points) → DC 18 becomes DC 14

#### Precious Object Sacrifice (Sentimental Value)

Destroy something personally meaningful.

- Treasured keepsake (mother's locket, first weapon) → **-3 DC**
- Irreplaceable item (spellbook, unique magical item) → **-5 DC**
- Defining item (familiar, holy symbol) → **-7 DC**
- Object completely destroyed in casting

**Restrictions:**
- Must establish importance through play
- Can't sacrifice same type repeatedly
- GM approval required

#### Life Sacrifice (Dark Magic)

Sacrifice living creatures. Marks you as evil.

- Item-sized creature (rat, cat) → **-1 DC**
- Person-sized creature → **-3 DC**
- Warhorse-sized creature → **-5 DC**
- Elephant-sized creature → **-7 DC**
- Creature dies, no save

**Restrictions:**
- Severe narrative consequences
- May attract dark powers or authorities
- Party members may object or turn on you
- Some Circles (especially Holy) may refuse this

#### Combination Sacrifices

Multiple types can combine.

**Example:** STR -1 (-2 DC) + destroy treasured sword (-3 DC) = -5 DC total

#### Sacrifice Notes

**Why use sacrifice:**
- Access spells beyond normal capability
- Emergency power when HP cost would kill
- Dramatic narrative moments

**Balancing factors:**
- Attribute sacrifice: long recovery (1 week/point)
- Precious objects: can't replace
- Life sacrifice: heavy moral/narrative costs
- None help with "keep spell" threshold (still need DC+10)

**GM Guidelines:**
- Require genuine sacrifice, not throwaway items
- Make consequences real (weakened stats affect everything)
- Let PCs react to dark sacrifices
- Consider if life sacrifice fits your table
- Sacrifice should feel weighty, not routine

## Aptitude Synergies

When a character possesses certain inherent aptitudes together, they may unlock powerful combination abilities. These synergies represent how natural traits work together in unexpected ways.

**Restriction:** Only inherent aptitudes can form synergies. Learned skills don't combine this way.

**GM Approval:** Synergies are approved on a case-by-case basis. Using one synergy in your campaign doesn't mean you must allow them all—choose which fit your game.

### Flight Synergy

**Requirements:** Wings + (Lightweight OR Small)

**Effect:** You gain true flight. Fly at your normal movement speed. You can hover and maneuver freely in three dimensions.

**Without Synergy:** Wings alone only allows gliding short distances and breaking falls. You cannot gain altitude or sustain flight.

**Character Concepts:**
- **Wings + Lightweight**: Bird-folk, light-framed draclings, winged elves with hollow bones
- **Wings + Small**: Pixies, fairies, sprites, tiny fey creatures

**Balance Notes:** Flight requires investing two inherent aptitude slots, making it a defining character choice. Each component aptitude has trade-offs:
- **Lightweight**: -2 inventory slots
- **Small**: -3 inventory slots, reduced weapon damage

### Powered Flight

**Requirements:** Wings + Fuel

**Effect:** True flight at normal speed while burning fuel. Consumes one fuel unit per exploration turn of flight (or per combat). Without fuel, Wings functions normally (glide only).

**Trade-off:** Resource dependent—must manage fuel supply.

**Character Concepts:** Clockwork angels, steam-powered constructs, coal-burning automatons

### Arcane Lift

**Requirements:** Wings + Arcane Core

**Effect:** True flight, but only while within near range of an active magical effect (spell, enchanted item, magical location). In mundane areas, Wings functions normally (glide only).

**Trade-off:** Location/situation dependent—can't fly everywhere.

**Character Concepts:** Magic-infused constructs, ley line surfers, spell-tethered beings

### Labored Flight

**Requirements:** Wings + Tough

**Effect:** True flight at half movement speed. Can carry heavy loads while flying. Flight is loud and obvious (disadvantage on stealth while airborne).

**Trade-off:** Slow and conspicuous—no aerial stealth.

**Character Concepts:** Heavy dragons, armored gargoyles, winged ogres, thunderbirds

### Burst Flight

**Requirements:** Wings + Spring Legs

**Effect:** Powerful launch—fly up to far distance as a single action, then must land. Cannot hover or sustain flight across multiple rounds.

**Trade-off:** No sustained flight—leap-and-land only.

**Character Concepts:** Grasshopper-folk, pouncing predators, rocket-jumpers

### Burrowing

**Requirements:** Digstorm + Natural Weapons

**Effect:** Burrow through earth at half movement speed, leaving tunnels behind you. Can attack from below for advantage on your first strike.

**Character Concepts:** Giant moles, ankhegs, sand wurms, earth elementals

### Aquatic Mastery

**Requirements:** Amphibious + Hold Breath

**Effect:** True aquatic creature—breathe underwater indefinitely, swim at full speed, advantage on all underwater actions.

**Character Concepts:** Deep merfolk, water elementals, sea serpents, aboleths

### Echolocation

**Requirements:** Keen Hearing + Darkvision

**Effect:** "See" through sound—function normally while blinded, immune to visual illusions, detect invisible creatures within near range by sound.

**Character Concepts:** Bat-folk, cave dwellers, blind seers, sonic hunters

### Living Fortress

**Requirements:** Natural Armor + Armor Skin

**Effect:** AC 14 base (instead of 12 or +2), and resistance to critical hits (crits don't reduce your AC).

**Character Concepts:** Stone giants, armadillo-folk, living statues, iron golems

### Ambush Predator

**Requirements:** Rush In + Sense Danger

**Effect:** Always act first in combat (no initiative roll needed), and your first attack each combat has advantage.

**Character Concepts:** Apex predators, hunting cats, assassin bugs, velociraptors

### Shadow Walker

**Requirements:** Shadow Step + NightVision

**Effect:** Shadow Step becomes at-will in dim light or darkness (no longer limited to once per long rest).

**Character Concepts:** Shadow fey, umbral stalkers, living shadows, night hunters

### Coordinated Swarm

**Requirements:** Split Form + Hivemind

**Effect:** When split, ALL three forms can take actions each round (instead of just one). Forms can share sensory information instantly, gaining advantage on perception. With Circle of Magic, can cast up to three spells per round (one per form).

**Trade-off:** Each form has only 1/3 HP. Stats are assigned whole (not split), so losing a form means losing those stats until it recovers.

**Character Concepts:** Swarm colonies, modular golems, three goblins in a trenchcoat, distributed consciousness

## Gaining Inherent Aptitudes After Character Creation

**Skill Aptitudes** can always be learned through training at level-up.

**Inherent Aptitudes** are much harder to gain after character creation. They represent fundamental changes to your nature or awakening of dormant potential.

### With a Demihuman Species Keyword

If a character already has a demihuman species keyword (Dwarf, Elf, Dracling, etc.), they can gain additional Inherent Aptitudes that fit that species concept.

**Requirements:**
- Must fit existing species keyword
- Needs strong narrative justification
- GM approval required
- May require significant resources, time, or story cost

**Examples:**
- **Dracling** (already has Wings) → gains Breath Weapon through:
  - Quest to awaken draconic heritage
  - Exposure to ancient dragon magic
  - Coming of age ritual

- **Dwarf** (already has Darkvision) → gains Treasure Sense through:
  - Training with master delver
  - Blessing from earth spirits
  - Awakening ancestral memories

- **Elf** (already has NightVision) → gains Soulspell through:
  - Tapping into fey bloodline
  - Decades of meditation
  - Gift from archfey patron

**Important:** These should feel like major character developments, not casual choices.

### Gaining Transformation Keywords

Characters can gain new keywords during play that justify Inherent Aptitudes, even if they started as human.

This represents **dramatic transformation**, not just learning:

**Examples:**
- **Werewolf bite** → gain "Lycanthrope" keyword → justifies Natural Weapons, Feral Attack
- **Witch's curse** → gain "Cursed" keyword → justifies Demon Tail, Sense Danger
- **Magical ritual** → gain "Gargoyle" keyword → justifies Armor Skin, Wings
- **Divine blessing** → gain "Blessed" keyword → justifies Sylvan Knowledge
- **Infernal pact** → gain "Infernal" keyword → justifies Sense Infernal, Demon Tail
- **Construct conversion** → gain "Construct" keyword → justifies Fuel, Compartments

**Requirements for Transformation:**
- Significant story event (not off-screen)
- GM approval and narrative buy-in
- Fundamentally changes who the character is
- May have costs:
  - Permanent HP loss
  - Long downtime/recovery
  - Quests to complete transformation
  - Social consequences

**After Transformation:**
- Character is no longer human (if they were before)
- They gain the transformation keyword
- This justifies gaining related Inherent Aptitudes at level-up
- May affect how NPCs react to them

**Example Transformation:**

Kara the Human Fighter (Cleave, Resilient) is bitten by a werewolf during a full moon adventure.

**Immediate:** She survives the bite through Constitution tests and healing magic.

**Short term:** She gains the "Lycanthrope" keyword. NPCs may fear or shun her.

**At next level-up (level 3):** She can choose Natural Weapons as her new aptitude, representing her lycanthropic transformation.

**At future level-up (level 5):** She might gain Feral Attack or Regeneration, further embracing the curse.

**Narrative:** Kara is no longer purely human—she's a lycanthrope, with all the story implications that brings.

## Capped Explosions

By default, exploding damage can chain infinitely—rolling maximum on a damage die lets you roll again, and if that's also maximum, you keep rolling. This creates exciting moments but can result in extreme damage spikes, especially from multi-attack monsters.

**When to Use This Rule:**

Consider capping explosions if your group experiences:
- Characters dropped from full HP to 0 in a single hit
- Players feeling frustrated by "bad luck" one-shots
- Difficulty balancing encounters due to explosion variance
- Preference for tactical play over high-variance chaos

**How It Works:**

When you roll maximum damage on any damage die, roll that die again and add it. **If this second roll is also maximum, stop**—the explosion caps at one additional die. Do not continue the chain.

**Maximum Damage With Cap:**
- **d10 weapons**: 20 damage maximum (10+10)
- **d8 weapons**: 16 damage maximum (8+8)
- **d6 weapons**: 12 damage maximum (6+6)
- **d4 weapons**: 8 damage maximum (4+4)

**Examples:**

*Without cap (default):*
- Ogre club: Roll d10 = 10 → roll 10 → roll 7 = **27 damage**
- Longsword: Roll d8 = 8 → roll 8 → roll 8 → roll 3 = **27 damage**

*With cap (optional):*
- Ogre club: Roll d10 = 10 → roll 10 → **stop** = **20 damage**
- Longsword: Roll d8 = 8 → roll 8 → **stop** = **16 damage**

**Balance Notes:**

Unlimited explosions (default) embrace chaos and create memorable moments. Players often love seeing dice explode repeatedly. However, multi-attack creatures rolling multiple dice per round increase the probability of catastrophic damage chains.

Capping at one explosion per roll still preserves excitement—rolling double-maximum feels great—while preventing the extreme outliers that can instantly kill characters with no counterplay.

**Recommendation:** Start with unlimited explosions (default) and only add this cap if your group finds the swinginess frustrating. Some tables thrive on chaos; others prefer predictability.

---

## Gritty Fortune

By default, Fortune Points provide a safety net—players can reroll failed tests and even help allies in desperate moments. For grittier, more dangerous campaigns, consider limiting or removing Fortune entirely.

**Variant: Limited Fortune**

Reduce the maximum Fortune Points from 3 to 1. Players start sessions with 0 Fortune instead of 1, earning their single point only through natural 20s or exceptional play. This makes Fortune feel precious and forces harder choices about when to spend it.

**Variant: No Fortune**

Remove Fortune Points entirely. Every roll stands. This creates a tense, unforgiving game where preparation and tactics matter more than luck mitigation. Recommended only for groups who enjoy high-stakes play where death is a real possibility.

**Variant: Shared Fortune**

The party shares a single Fortune pool (maximum 3-5 depending on party size). Any player can spend from the pool, but replenishment is slower—only one point per session start, plus natural 20s. This encourages teamwork and creates interesting group dynamics around resource management.

**When to Use These Rules:**

Consider gritty Fortune variants if your group wants:
- Higher stakes and permanent consequences
- A horror or survival tone
- Emphasis on tactical planning over heroic comebacks
- Faster, deadlier combat

**Warning:** Removing or limiting Fortune significantly increases lethality. Combine with other survivability options (more starting HP, easier healing, retreat rules) if you want grit without constant character death.
