# Character Creation Guide

**Create your character and start playing!**

A character consists of a few aspects:

- **Stats** are used to perform tests
- **Aptitudes** give your character special abilities based on their training, or innate abilities
- **Keywords** are narrative descriptors that you can use to justify advantage
- **Inventory Slots** are where you stow your gear and equip spells

Creating a character in Rath RPG is as fast and easy as you want it to be. If you're new to RPGs, Just follow the steps below.

## Aptitudes and Species

In Rath RPG, Aptitudes are special abilities that help differentiate and define who and what your character is, what they're capable of, and what their specialties are. These work in conjunction with **Keywords** to define your character.

Your aptitude choices at creation determine your species:

- If you take 2 **Skill Aptitudes**, your character is **Human** (or close enough)
	- Humans are versatile, adaptable learners
- If you take at least 1 **Inherent Aptitude**, your character is a **Demihuman**
	- Demihumans have innate capabilities or abilities

Think of **Aptitude** choices as "building a class"

**Skill Aptitudes** are learned abilities (combat techniques, magic, thievery, survival).

**Inherent Aptitudes** are innate traits (darkvision, natural weapons, wings, scales).

---

## Step 1: Select Aptitudes

Choose **any 2 aptitudes** from the **Aptitude Reference** that fit your character concept. There are no limitations.

**New to RPGs?** The tables below can help guide you to quickly choose your **Aptitudes**. Are you a noble fighting man, a sneaky goblin, or an aspiring spellcaster?

Pick a classic role and choose 2 **Skill Aptitudes** from its suggestions:

| Role            | Suggested Aptitudes                                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Warrior**     | Cleave, Resilient, Berserker, Protect                |
| **Knight**      | Duelist, Protect, Resilient, Shield Bash             |
| **Thief**       | Break and Enter, Move Silently and Unseen, Backstab  |
| **Assassin**    | Backstab, Dagger Master, Poison Use                  |
| **Ranger**      | Hawkeye, Wild Walker, Marksman, Quick Draw           |
| **Scout**       | Move Silently and Unseen, Wild Walker, Dungeon Sense |

| **Bard**        | Silver Tongue, Inspiring Presence, Multilingual      |

> **Note:** Circle of Magic requires choosing a Circle from the **Magic Reference**. Spellcasters add complexity—new players may prefer non-magical roles for their first character.

**Demihuman?** Pick at least one **Inherent Aptitude**:

| Concept       | Suggested Aptitudes                                         |

## Step 2: Keywords

Choose **2-3 keywords**:

1. **Species** (Required): Human, Dwarf, Elf, Orc, Halfling, Construct, etc.
2. **Role** (Required): Fighter, Thief, Wizard, Ranger, Barbarian, etc.
3. **Background** (Optional): Add now or during play (Noble, Outlaw, Sailor, etc.)

**Using Keywords:** Justify advantage on relevant tests ("As a Ranger, I have advantage tracking this beast"). They also help define your character narratively.

## Step 3: Assign Stats

Choose ONE method:

### Method 1: Plan Ahead
Distribute these values: **3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0**

Place in any order across your six stats.

### Method 2: Roll the Bones
Roll **3d6 for each stat in order** (STR, DEX, INT, WIS, CON, CHA).

The **lowest die** = that stat's value.

When done, you may **swap any two stats**.

### The Six Stats

| Stat | Used For |
|---|---|
| **STR** | Melee attacks, lifting, breaking, physical power |
| **DEX** | Ranged attacks, dodging, climbing, sneaking |

| **WIS** | Perception, tracking, navigation, finding secrets |
| **CON** | Resisting poison/sickness/environment, added to healing |
| **CHA** | Persuasion, deception, intimidation, charm |

## Step 4: Calculate Derived Stats

| Stat | Formula |
|---|---|
| **HP** | 10 + STR (+ aptitude bonuses) |
| **AC** | 10 + DEX + armor bonus |
| **Inventory Slots** | 10 + CON |
