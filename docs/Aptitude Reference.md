## Introduction

### What Are Aptitudes?

**Aptitudes** are special abilities that define what your character can do. You start with **2 aptitudes at level 1** and gain additional aptitudes at **levels 3, 5, 7, and 9** (maximum 6 total).

### Skill vs Inherent Aptitudes

**Skill Aptitudes** are learned abilities that can be freely chosen when gaining aptitudes. They represent training, practice, and mastery.

**Inherent Aptitudes** are innate traits that define your character's nature. After character creation, gaining Inherent Aptitudes requires **GM approval and narrative justification** (transformation, awakening latent abilities, etc.).

### Species and Aptitudes

Your aptitude choices determine your species type:
- **2 Skill Aptitudes** = Human
- **1-2 Inherent Aptitudes** = Demihuman (Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Beastfolk, Construct, etc.)
### Understanding "L" in Descriptions

**"L"** means your character level. For example, "L times per long rest" means once per long rest at level 1, twice at level 2, three times at level 3, etc.
