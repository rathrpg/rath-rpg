## 1. Basic Mechanics

### Tests

**Tests are the main mechanic in Rath**

To attempt something uncertain with consequences, roll a **Test**:

**d20 + relevant stat**

**Default DC** is **12**. 

**Success if total ≥ 13** (beats DC 12)

- **Natural 20**: Critical Success (GM determines special result)
- **Natural 1**: Critical Failure (GM determines complication)

The Default **DC** is **12**. Assume the target is 12 unless told otherwise. There are a some exceptions to this rule (To-Hit in combat, Spellcasting, etc.)

### Opposed Tests

When two characters compete directly:

Both sides roll d20 + applicable stat. **Highest total wins.**

**Examples:**
- Arm wrestling: Both roll d20 + STR
- Sneaking past guard: Thief rolls d20 + DEX vs Guard's d20 + WIS
- Lying convincingly: Liar rolls d20 + CHA vs Listener's d20 + WIS

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Some situations grant **advantage** or impose **disadvantage**:

- **Advantage**: Roll 2d20, take the **higher** result
- **Disadvantage**: Roll 2d20, take the **lower** result

**Granted by:** Situation, aptitudes, keywords, GM discretion

**Note:** Multiple sources don't stack—you either have it or you don't.

### Fortune Points

Track Fortune points for lucky breaks. **Max 3.**

**Usage:** Spend 1 Fortune point **after rolling** any test or attack to **reroll and keep the higher result**. You may spend your Fortune point on another character's roll if you are in a position to assist them. Describe how you are helping them when spending the fortune point.

**Awarding:**
- Start each session with 1 Fortune point
- Gain 1 Fortune when you roll a natural 20
- GM may award for exceptional roleplaying or heroic sacrifices
- There is no limit to how many fortune points you can use on a roll, but it's always either take the previous result, or use the new one.

## 2. Combat Summary

### Quick Combat Reference


1. Roll Initiative (d6: 1-3 enemies, 4-6 PCs)
2. Take your turn:
   - Move (up to Near) + Action
   - OR Run (up to Far, no action)
3. To Attack: d20 + STR/DEX vs target's AC
4. On hit: Roll weapon damage
5. Max damage? Roll that die again and add it!
6. Repeat until combat ends


### Initiative

At the start of each round, roll **1d6**:
- **1-3**: Enemies act first
- **4-6**: PCs act first

**Reroll each round** for dynamic, unpredictable combat.

> **Within each side**, players can act in any order they agree on.

### Actions in Combat

On your turn, you can:

**Standard Turn:**
- **Move** up to Near distance
- **Take an action** (attack, cast spell, use item, help ally, etc.)

**Running:**
- Give up your action to **move up to Far distance**

**Free Actions:**
- You can use a **free  action** at any point on your turn (shout warning, point, drop item)

**Ready Action:**
- Declare a trigger and hold your action to use as a **reaction** when it occurs

### Attacking

Roll **d20 + STR** (melee) or **DEX** (ranged)

- **If total ≥ target's AC**: Hit! Roll weapon damage
- **If lower**: Miss

**Unarmored AC = 10**

### Damage

Roll your **weapon's damage die** (d6 for most simple weapons, d8 for martial weapons, d10 for two-handed).

Add your **STR bonus** to melee damage.

**Exploding Damage:** When you roll **maximum** damage on any damage die, **roll that die again and add it** to the damage. If you roll maximum again, keep rolling and adding.

**Example:** Sword (d8). Roll 8 → roll again, get 8 → roll again, get 5 → total 21 damage.

### Critical Hits & Fumbles

**Natural 20 (Critical Hit):**
- Target loses **1 AC** until combat ends
- Stacks with weapon or aptitude crit effects

**Natural 1 (Fumble):**
- Thematic setback (drop weapon, slip, enemy gets advantage on next attack)
- GM determines appropriate consequence

> **Lost AC** represents damaged armor, poor positioning, exhaustion. Restored after combat ends.

---

## 3. Combat Maneuvers & Special Rules

### Two Weapons

After your first attack, you can make a second attack with **disadvantage**. You can target a different enemy.

### Sacrificing Shields

You can **destroy your shield** to absorb up to **15 damage**. Take any excess damage.

**Example:** Attack deals 18 damage. Sacrifice shield to absorb 15, take 3 damage.

### Stunts

**Shove, disarm, trip, sunder armor**, etc.

Resolved with **opposed tests** (usually STR vs STR or DEX vs DEX).

May cause indirect damage (pushing off ledge) or other effects. **GM has final say.**

---

## 4. Injury & Death

### Dropping to 0 HP

You are **out of action**:
- Can only crawl
- Cannot act in combat
- Cannot be tended during combat—must wait until danger passes

### Survival Test

When danger passes, make a **CON test (DC 12):**

**Success:** Stabilize and regain consciousness. Gain **1d6 HP**.

**Failure:** Roll **2d6** on the Critical Injury Table:

| 2d6 | Result |
|---|---|
| 2-3 | **Dead** - Make final words count |
| 4-6 | **Maimed** - Permanent injury (GM determines). Gain 1d6 HP |
| 7-9 | **Broken** - Need 1 week bed rest. Gain 1d6 HP |
| 10-11 | **Battered** - Need 1 day rest. Gain 1d6 HP |
| 12 | **Tough Bastard** - Gain 2d6 HP, return to action! |

### Death's Door

If PCs are at enemy mercy when combat ends:
- Likely killed or eaten
- Possibly patched up for ransom or slavery
- Depends on enemy intelligence and motivation

---

## 5. Conditions & Hazards

Environmental dangers and afflictions that cause ongoing harm.

### Condition Dice System

Some threats create **ongoing conditions** that harm you over time. These use **Condition Dice** - a dice pool that naturally diminishes as your body fights off the affliction.

**Each turn (combat) or interval (exploration):**
1. Roll all condition dice
2. **If any dice show 1-2**, suffer the condition's effect
3. **Remove** all dice showing **5-6** (condition fading)
4. When the pool is empty, the condition ends

**As dice disappear, the condition becomes less likely to trigger.**

**Tracking Tip:** At the start of your turn, write down how many condition dice you have (e.g., "5d6 fire" or "3d6 poison"). Roll that many d6s, apply the effect for any 1-2s, remove any 5-6s, and write down the new total. This is easier than keeping physical dice in front of you.

**Multiple Sources:** If affected by the same condition multiple times (e.g., two poisoned arrows), add the new dice to your existing pool.

### Poison

When a character is **poisoned**, they suffer ongoing effects until their body fights it off or they receive treatment.

**Being Poisoned:**

When first poisoned, make a **CON test DC 12**:
- **Success:** Start with half the dice (round down, minimum 2d6)
- **Failure:** Start with the full dice pool

Create a **condition dice pool** based on the poison's severity:
- **Weak poison:** 4d6
- **Moderate poison:** 6d6
- **Strong poison:** 8d6
- **Lethal poison:** 10d6+

**Each turn (in combat) or 10 minutes (out of combat):**
1. Roll all poison dice
2. **If any dice show 1-2**, the poison's effect triggers:
   - **Damage:** Take 1 damage per die showing 1-2
   - **Paralysis:** Can't act this turn
   - **Sleep:** Fall unconscious. Wake if shaken/damaged
   - **Weakness:** Disadvantage on physical tests this turn
3. **Remove** all dice showing **5-6** (poison wearing off)

**Curing Poison:**
- **Antitoxin (Basic):** Remove 2d6 from poison pool (5 gp)
- **Antitoxin (Superior):** Remove 4d6 from poison pool (20 gp)
- **Temple/Healer:** Remove all poison dice (1 gp)
- **Short rest:** Make CON test to remove additional 1d6
- **Long rest:** Make CON test to remove additional 2d6

### Fire

When ignited, you suffer **4-6d6 fire condition** depending on the source.

**Each turn:**
1. Roll fire dice
2. **If any show 1-2:** Take 1 damage per die showing 1-2
3. **Remove** all 5-6s (flames dying down)

**Stop the fire:** Use action to **drop and roll** (**DEX test DC 12**) or be doused with water - immediately remove 2d6 from the pool.

### Bleeding

When suffering a major wound, you may have **4d6 bleeding condition**.

**Each turn:**
1. Roll bleeding dice
2. **If any show 1-2:** Take 1 damage per die showing 1-2
3. **Remove** all 5-6s (blood clotting)

**Stop the bleeding:** Use action to **apply pressure/bandage** (no test required) - immediately remove 2d6 from the pool.

### Disease

When infected, you suffer **6-8d6 disease condition** (GM determines severity).

**Being Diseased:**

When first infected, make a **CON test DC 12**:
- **Success:** Start with half the dice (round down, minimum 2d6)
- **Failure:** Start with the full dice pool

**Each hour (or day for slow diseases):**
1. Roll disease dice
2. **If any show 1-2:** Take 1 damage per die showing 1-2 and feel weakened
3. **Remove** all 5-6s (immune system fighting back)

**Cure disease:** Temple cure (1 gp), healing spells, or let it run its course.

### Drowning

When out of air underwater, you suffer **6d6 drowning condition**.

**Each round underwater:**
1. Roll drowning dice
2. **If any show 1-2:** Take 1 damage per die showing 1-2
3. **Remove** all 5-6s

**Reach air:** Condition ends immediately when you surface and can breathe. This also applies if you gain the ability to breathe underwater (via spell, magic item, etc.).

## 6. Time & Distance

### Time Units

- **Round**: A moment to a minute (one turn in combat)
- **Turn**: 1-10 minutes (10 rounds, typical dungeon exploration pace)
- **Hour**: 6 turns
- **Day**: 24 hours

### Distance & Movement

Choose **one system** and use it consistently:

**Abstract Distances (Theatre of the Mind):**
- **Close**: Adjacent, melee range (5-10 ft)
- **Near**: Bow range, one move action (~20-30 feet)
- **Far**: Requires running, long range (~40-60 feet)
- **Distant**: Beyond immediate combat (~60+ feet)

**Specific Measurements (For Miniatures):**
- **Movement**: 20 ft normally, 40 ft if running (give up action)
- **Melee Range**: Adjacent (5 ft)
- **Bow Range**: 60 ft
- **Crossbow Range**: 80 ft

---

## 7. Rest & Recovery

### Short Rest

Takes about **an hour (6 turns)** in a relatively safe spot.

**During a short rest:**
- Recover **1d6 + CON** HP
- Casters can **unburn one spell** of their choice
- Characters can use abilities that recharge on short rest
- Can eat, drink, and catch breath
- Not long enough to change equipped spells or fully recover HP

### Long Rest

Takes **6-8 hours of sleep** or restful activity in a safe location (camp, inn).

**During a long rest:**
- Recover **full HP**
- **Unburn all spells**
- Characters can **change equipped spells**
- All abilities that recharge on long rest become available
- Can **spend XP to level up**
- Recover from temporary conditions (not permanent injuries)

### Recovering HP

- **Short Rest**: 1d6 + CON HP
- **Long Rest**: Full HP
- **Rations**: Eating provides comfort for resting
- **Potions**: Healing potions restore HP immediately
- **Healing aptitudes**: Heal, Arcane Healing, Field Medicine, etc.

## 8. Traps and Locks

### The Advantage Scale System

Traps and locks exist on an advantage scale: **Impossible → Disadvantage → Straight Roll → Advantage**

**Detecting Traps:**
Any character can actively search for traps. Spend your turn examining a 10 ft area and make a **WIS test DC 12**. Success reveals the trap's location and general mechanism.

**Disabling Traps and Picking Locks:**
Once detected, anyone can attempt to disable a trap or pick a lock with thieves' tools. Make a **DEX test DC 12 with disadvantage**. Without thieves' tools, disabling/picking is impossible (though you can attempt to trigger traps safely from a distance).

**Failing by 5+ when disabling a trap triggers it.**

### Complex Traps and Locks

Some traps and locks are particularly sophisticated. Complex traps/locks shift you down one step on the advantage scale:
- **Advantage** becomes a **straight roll**
- **Straight roll** becomes **disadvantage**
- **Disadvantage** becomes **impossible**

**Tool Durability:**
When you fail to pick a lock or disable a trap by 5 or more, your thieves' tools break and must be replaced (1 gp).

### Aptitudes That Help

- **Dungeon Sense**: Advantage on detection + learn detailed mechanics (how it triggers, what it does, bypass methods, and complexity)
- **Break and Enter**: Advantage with tools (straight roll on complex), can improvise without tools
- **Trapsmith**: Advantage with tools (straight roll on complex), can work without tools (disadvantage on complex), assess complexity at a glance

## 9. Advancement

### Experience Points (XP)

**Milestone system:** Gain **1 XP per session** where something substantial happened.

**Level up cost:** Spend XP equal to your current level during a long rest or between sessions.

- Level 1 → 2: 1 XP
- Level 2 → 3: 2 XP
- Level 3 → 4: 3 XP
- And so on...

### What Happens When You Level Up

**1. Increase Hit Points**

Roll **d8s equal to your new level + STR**:
- If total > current max HP, that becomes your new max HP
- If total ≤ current max HP, add 1 to your current max HP

**Example:** Level 2 Fighter (STR 3) with 14 HP levels up to 3. Rolls 3d8+3 and gets 19. New max HP = 19. If they rolled 12, new max HP = 15 (14 + 1).

**2. Increase One Stat**

Choose any stat and increase it by **1**.

**Limits:**
- No stat can exceed **10** (hard cap)
- No stat can be more than **Level + 2** (soft cap)

**3. Gain New Aptitude (at levels 3, 5, 7, 9)**

At levels **3, 5, 7, and 9**, choose a new aptitude. **Maximum 6 total aptitudes.**

**Skill Aptitudes:** Choose freely from the **Aptitude Reference**

**Inherent Aptitudes:** Require **GM approval and narrative justification**

**At level 9+:** May replace an unwanted aptitude when gaining a new one
